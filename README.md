## Introducing oneself

> <ruby>私<rt>わたし</rt></ruby>は<ruby>田中<rt>たかな</rt></ruby>です。

> 私は田中だ。

Common, textbook way on introducing oneself, assuming one’s surname (last name) was 田中, Tanaka.

だ is familiar. です is politer. There are at least two dimensions in interpersonal relations. *Status*, and *distance*. One can be higher status (older, more experienced, etc.) than someone, or lower, or the same; one can also be close to someone (family, longtime friend), or distant from them. One can hurt or offend with speech assuming the wrong status or distance—too close, too distant, too familiar, too formal.

は is pronounced わ—don’t ask.

## Another way

One can also say,

> 私が田中です。

The difference is は versus が, the distinction between the two being guaranteed to be discussed in your “Japanese WTF” book. The way I think about it, は lenses attention towards what follows it—when you say 「私は…」 we are hanging on to the edge of our seats, waiting for what comes after: you are WHOM? Tell us, tell us!

Meanwhile, が lenses attention to the thing just before it: by the time you’ve said 「私が…」 we know the most important thing is 私—no matter what follows, the important thing is that it’s 私 that’s that. Not you, not her, but me.

## Pronouns

More first-person pronouns: more polite than <ruby>私<rt>わたし</rt></ruby> is <ruby>私<rt>わたくし</rt></ruby>. The teacher and the superintendent in [３５歳の高校生](http://wiki.d-addicts.com/35-sai_no_Koukousei) both use this. The superintendent also uses <ruby>我<rt>わ</rt></ruby>が.

Men (and [certain](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bokukko) women) can use <ruby>僕<rt>ぼく</rt></ruby>. The author–ethnogother of [Crested Kimono](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/878425523) (1991) finds that he must refer to himself with 僕 to prevent matrons from trying to set him up with young women.

In very familiar settings, men refer to themselves as <ruby>俺<rt>おれ</rt></ruby>.

The second-person pronoun (“you”), at <ruby>私<rt>わたし</rt></ruby>-grade politeness, is あなた, while <ruby>君<rt>きみ</rt></ruby> and お<ruby>前<rt>まえ</rt></ruby> are increasingly very familiar.

The third-person pronouns of <ruby>彼<rt>かれ</rt></ruby> and <ruby>彼女<rt>かのじ</rt></ruby> are also used to refer to boy/girlfriends, and these, like the second-person pronouns, are used sparingly.

あの<ruby>人<rt>ひと</rt></ruby> means “that person” and can be a handy pronoun.

Just refer to people, even the person you’re talking to, by their family name plus the さん honorific, e.g., 田中さん.
